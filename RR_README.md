# Monetary Movie Industry Analysis

**Authors**: [Robert Reynoso](mailto:robert@birdstop.io)

## Overview

This project is an analysis into the movie industry. 
More espefically analysing the monetary success of films with respect to movie genres, realease dates,and movie studios in the United States. 

## Business Problem

The business problem for this project is a report on the movie industry that will allow Microsoft producers to make informed decisions in the creation of thier new movie stusio. In the U.S., success can be described through moneteray means. Thus given the available data sets (names used?)insights into how to maximize profit are shown using 3 seperate analysis. Throguh the data, we are able to see which movie genre makes the most profit, which month for a given movie release yields more profit, and which current studios have been most profitable.

Questions to consider:
* What are the business's pain points related to this project?
* How did you pick the data analysis question(s) that you did?
* Why are these questions important from a business perspective?
***

## Data

Describe the data being used for this project.

***
Questions to consider:
* Where did the data come from, and how do they relate to the data analysis questions?
* What do the data represent? Who is in the sample and what variables are included?
* What is the target variable?
* What are the properties of the variables you intend to use?
***

## Methods

Describe the process for analyzing or modeling the data. For Phase 1, this will be descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How did you prepare, analyze or model the data?
* Why is this approach appropriate given the data and the business problem?
***

## Results

Present your key results. For Phase 1, this will be findings from your descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How do you interpret the results?
* How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?
***

Here is an example of how to embed images from your sub-folder:
